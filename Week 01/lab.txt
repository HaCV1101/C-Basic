You look for me Inside the dark I am the ocean
You are the shark
You hunt me like
Your last goodbye
Oh fallen angel Of the night
Just take my heart
Just rip it out
This holy skin
It's falling out
I lay my body
On the bed
One day, someday
You know I will see you again
I put my hand against your plastic heart
No, suicide is not the plan, stand up
Even the stars are trapped inside, oh my
There's nothing left to hide
There's nothing left to die
There's nothing left to die
I put my hand against your plastic heart
No, suicide is not the plan, stand up
