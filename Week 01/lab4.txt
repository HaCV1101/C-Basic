47 You look for me Inside the dark I am the ocean
18 You are the shark
17 You hunt me like
18 Your last goodbye
29 Oh fallen angel Of the night
19 Just take my heart
16 Just rip it out
15 This holy skin
17 It's falling out
14 I lay my body
11 On the bed
17 One day, someday
30 You know I will see you again
41 I put my hand against your plastic heart
38 No, suicide is not the plan, stand up
41 Even the stars are trapped inside, oh my
29 There's nothing left to hide
28 There's nothing left to die
28 There's nothing left to die
41 I put my hand against your plastic heart
38 No, suicide is not the plan, stand up
38 No, suicide is not the plan, stand up
