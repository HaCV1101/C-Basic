Look around everywhere you turn is heartache
It's everywhere that you go...
(Look around)
You try everything you can to escape
The pain of life that you know
(Life that you know)
When all else fails and you long to be
Something better than you are today
I know a place where you can get away
It's called a dance floor and here's what it's for so
Come on Vogue
Vogue
Let your body move to the music
(Move to the music) Hey hey hey
Come on Vogue
Vogue
Let your body go with the flow
(Go with the flow) You know you can do it
All you need is your own imagination
So use it that's what it's for
(That's what it's for)
Go inside for your finest inspiration
Your dreams will open the doorâ€¦
